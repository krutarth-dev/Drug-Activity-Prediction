# Drug-Activity-Prediction

Drugs usually consist of small organic molecules that achieve their intended effects by attaching themselves to a specific location on a receptor. The initial stage in discovering a new drug typically involves identifying and isolating the receptor that the drug should bind to. Subsequently, numerous small molecules are tested to determine their capability to bind to the target site. This process presents researchers with the challenge of distinguishing between active compounds that bind and inactive ones that do not. By making this determination, researchers can then utilize the information to design new compounds that not only bind but also possess all the necessary properties required for a drug, such as solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, and toxicity levels. The objective of this project is to develop predictive models capable of determining whether a particular compound is active (1) or inactive (0). Therefore, the aim is to create the most effective binary classification model.
